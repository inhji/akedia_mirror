# Akedia

Akedia is the result of a simple idea: A place for my digital self. A (micro-)blog, a knowledgebase, a place for experiments. A project that doesn't get scrapped after a few months. 

It took me at least five years to get it where it is now. 

During that time, I went through a series of attempts in various programming languages and emotions regarding the project. I abandoned it more than once, telling myself it couldn't be done, discovered the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org), [Elixir](https://indieweb.org)/[Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) and [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) and many more exiting projects.

I'm proud of what I've achieved with this project. At the same time I know there will always be something to tweak, tinker with or fix. Which is what keeps me going I guess.
